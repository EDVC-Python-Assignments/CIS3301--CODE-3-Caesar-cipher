## CODE-3-Caesar-Cipher

## Instructions

In this CODE assignment, you will program a Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest mechanisms to encrypt information. The cipher relies on substitution to encrypt and decrypt information. In this assignment, we will only encrypt information.

There are two elements in a Caesar Cipher:

*  Secret: word to encrypt
*  Key: number of characters the word will be changed by.


## Use the following user prompts

* Welcome the user
  + **"\nCaesar Cipher - Program"**
* Request the secret from the user
  + **"\nEnter the word to encrypt: "** (note the space after the colon)
* Request the key from the user
  + **"Enter your key: "** (note the space after the colon)
* Return the encrypted word to the user
  + **"\nThe encrypted word is encrypted_word\n"** (replace encrypted_word with the appropriate word)
